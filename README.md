# CSEN383 - Advanced Operating Systems Projects

A collection of projects demonstrating various operating system concepts and implementations.

## Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure:
- `src/` - Source code files
- `docs/` - Assignment documents and project specifications

## Projects

### [Project 1 - Process Management](./Project%201%20-%20Process%20Management/)
Implementation of process management concepts including fork operations and process creation.

### [Project 2 - CPU Scheduling](./Project%202%20-%20CPU%20Scheduling/)
Implementation of CPU scheduling algorithms and their behavior analysis.

### [Project 3 - Memory Management](./Project%203%20-%20Memory%20Management/)
Memory management concepts including paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.

### [Project 4 - File Systems](./Project%204%20-%20File%20Systems/)
File system operations, directory structures, and file system design.

### [Project 5 - Inter-Process Communication](./Project%205%20-%20Inter-Process%20Communication/)
Inter-process communication mechanisms including shared memory and message passing.

### [Project 6 - Pipes and Select](./Project%206%20-%20Pipes%20and%20Select/)
Implementation of pipes and select() system call for I/O multiplexing.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the specific project directory
2. Check the project's README.md for specific instructions
3. Compile and run the source code as documented

## TODO: Running Projects

- [ ] Set up development environment (Ubuntu/VirtualBox)
- [ ] Install required dependencies (gcc, g++, make)
- [ ] Test compilation for each project
- [ ] Document specific run instructions for each project
- [ ] Add example outputs and expected behavior

## Compilation Examples

```bash
# C files
gcc src/filename.c -o executable

# C++ files  
g++ src/filename.cpp -o executable
```
